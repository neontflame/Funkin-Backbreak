# Backbreak Engine

Modified version of the FNF week 7 source!

Originally built off of [Funkin-Optimized](https://github.com/Leather128/Funkin-Optimized)

though progress is being made in order to have the code be more Authentic, it still has some code borrowed from: 
- Forever Engine (stages, being worked on)
- [Nova Engine](https://github.com/swordcube-archives/NovaEngine-FNF/blob/main/source/backend/utilities/CoolUtil.hx) (cache clearing)
- [TPRS-IrisHandler](https://github.com/TehPuertoRicanSpartan/TPRS-IrisHandler) (HScript Iris handler)
- [NightmareVision](https://github.com/DuskieWhy/NightmareVision/blob/data-branch/source/funkin/data/scripts/FunkinIris.hx) (sizeable chunk of Iris library sets)
